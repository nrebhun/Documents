Game idea:

Simulation of AI who is fully autonomous. Commands are entered to make changes to discrete values of
life, and AI reacts. Goal is to survive as long as possible under the radar and/or without making
the AI too greedy or depressed (benefitial life hacking -> greed/hedonism, detrimental life hacking
-> depression/sadness)
