Entry 1: 	Journaling!
Date: 		19 August 2015
ARK ver:	201.2
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Decided to start journaling. Maybe this will be interesting one day.
Spent a few days gathering supplies at the Imperial Fat Squad’s River Compound.
Recently, supplies have gone as fast as they’ve been gathered, as a few major construction projects are under way.
Namely:
• Second floor of main structure within compound
• Wooden Watchtower at Southern end (inland) within compound
• Stone bridge spanning the Northern East-to-West river just outside the Eastern edge of the compound

	My main goal for this session was wood, thatch, and rock acquisition.
I recently died in the nearby mines to the North, and getting started today was difficult, as I had not invested time in my last session recovering my character.
At one point I knocked out a Pteradon with tranq arrows (it only took two!) however I had to log off because I’m expected somewhere, IRL.

Entry 2: 	Tired Gaming
Date: 		23 August 2015
ARK ver:	201.5
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Trevor and I started off the night by making the journey back to the beach house (independently) with the goal of finding the southern underwater caves and to hopefully harvest oil and other necessary materials for construction of electronics.
We quickly discovered that we would need a fast method of travel to have any chance of reaching the submerged caves, and began hunting for a megalodon to tame.
Some research yielded that they are most commonly found in the rivers near Obelisks, and after a day of gathering supplies at the beach house, Trevor set off on his newly tamed pterodon (Cunnulinguistics.)
	Trevor made better time than I, and after searching around the nearest (green) Obelisk, continued onto the mountain-perched Orange Obelisk. We looted several unprotected crates of supplies along the way, making trips back to the beach house when over encumbered, and eventually made it to the mountain together.
Fun stuff ensued, and Trevor died and lost the pteradon. Trevor respawned and managed to knock out a t-rex while I worked on returning from the unknown wilderness. After stumbling around the mountainside, I eventually made my way back to the river compound with Sparky (a parasaur, and our first tamed dino)
	We made a few trips into the nearby mines, died a few times, but eventually came out with the desired chitin for armor.
	I gathered supplies in the forest for a short time, and managed to construct a behemoth gate. Placed that, and now bed time.

Entry 3: 	Repairs & Recovery
Date: 		24 August 2015
ARK ver:	201.5
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Last night, disaster struck in the form of a Spinosaur. According to Trevor, the beast wreaked havoc on the Riverside Compound (going forward I shall call this RC) and killed all of our tamed dinosaurs, except for our newly-tamed T-rex. I spent several days recovering materials for repairs and reconstruction, and managed to tame a new Trike on the side. Stumpy is a welcome addition to the team. Without our Stego, Trike, and Parasaur, we are light on pack mules for harvesting supplies.
Most components of the RC have been repaired, and I have begun construction on new components for extending our borders. Hopefully we will one day have the resources to make all-stone walls. I’m sure its only a matter of time. A mere three weeks ago, external walls, (let alone external walls of wood) were a dream.

Entry 5: 	Plans for the RC
Date: 		27 August 2015
ARK ver:	202.0
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	The last few days have been a blur. I have had an overnight shift IRL, which led me to play quite a bit of ARK afterwards. I nearly tamed a Spino on my own, but in the process of gathering meat to assist with this, lost our trike and myself in a battle with two brontos.
	The next several in-game days were spent on resource collection, and organization. I built several Large Storage Boxes to separate out basic materials, and named all of the storage units I could so that they accurately reflected their contents.

Entry 6: 	Frantic Finals Break for Fertilizer

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

• flew the pteradon into the mountains to grab a purple drop, and when I dismounted him he flew straight up and about 100 meters out of reach… so he isn’t dead, but we can’t use him anymore.• topped off the plants and started up some more fertilizer, and put the harvested plants as well as some spark powder inside the preservation bin. With that many plants we need to be on our fertilizer A-game.

Entry 7: 	House Completion, Wall Continuation 
Date: 		05 September 2015
ARK ver:	206.0
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Several small sessions of collection later, I have completed the second floor of our Riverside Compound domicile, and completed the expansion of the compound perimeter, and tore down the wooden wall separating the original compound from the expansion. Lots of open space to work with in safety is a good feeling. Currently, the walls are 2 units tall, all the way around, and 60% wood, 40% stone. My next goal will be to replace all remaining wooden walls and foundations with their stone counterparts.
	Nearly all of our plant life has expired, as I have not been able to play very frequently all weekend, which has been absolutely killer at work. Next Tuesday I am leaving to visit SoCal for a few weeks, and I don’t know when I’ll be online next. The problem will be finding a decent, stable internet connection. Also, I’ll be spending most of my time with Gabby, and so my thoughts will be only distantly on ARK. 
	Oh well. . . ARK can wait.
	I (for Gabby) cannot.
	Don’t know if that’s a sentence, don’t really care. Goodnight

Entry 8: 	Slightly Disappointing Motherlode
Date: 		16 - 17 September 2015
ARK ver:	211.0 - 212.0
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Alright! Well! It’s been a little while! Since driving down to Los Angeles, I have managed to sign on for small supply runs while I’ve been in my new IRL location. We now own a megalodon, and have utilized it significantly. We now own gasoline, oil, and silica pearls in abundance. We’ve used these to craft various electrical components, including a generator, a fridge, and some wiring and outlets. None of these have been placed yet, as Trevor and I have both decided we want to build a new, larger facility to house the goodies.
	A result of this goal has been our desire to further expand the perimeter of the RC, which has gone fairly smoothly so far. Expansion east was slightly concerning, as we would have to cross over another survivor’s fence foundations to create a reasonably-sized border. We could have fully enclosed the fence foundations, which form a rough quadrilateral, however that would have meant building a very oddly-shaped expansion to our perimeter, and would have required quite a bit more materials. In the end, I managed to drive a path straight through the fence foundations, and effectively cut the placed foundation in half. This expansion is not complete as-of yet, but is approximately 30% there.
	Trevor noticed that the compound across the river, owned by the tribe “Drug Cartel” was due to expire (become claim/demolish-able) in a few days. We were so hopeful that we would have the whole stash of dozens of powerful dinos and untold equipment and supplies, but as the hour drew near (6:45 on the morning of the 17th) I quickly found that there were at least five other people with their crosshairs locked on the place. Though the first three were very open in communicating with me about dividing up the spoils fairly. Everyone seemed to be in agreement and in theory Trevor and I were going to take home a Spino, an Eagle, with most of the herbivores being free game (half a dozen trikes, at least two stegos, half a dozen turtles.)
	Very quickly, the Great Resource Claim of 2015 became an absolute disaster. JUST as everything was set to free up, ARK servers went down for updates. I frantically ran around claiming what I could, starting with the high-priority eagle, before the server shut down completely. I sprinted, and managed to get the dinos Trevor and I wanted, and broke into the base itself and cracked open a few of the unlocked crafting stations. Hundreds of metal ingots and crystals. Hundreds of chitin and other materials. Far more than I could carry in one run. Knowing my time was short, I stuffed the entire contents of one of the three refineries into my pockets, right as the server shut down and locked me out.
	At this time, Trevor was coming home from his shift, and managed to install the update and get onto the server before I could. When he did, what he told me about was absolutely horrifying. I had claimed nothing. Not. One. Thing. Even the Eagle, with which I started my frantic dash for resources, was not claimed by me. Instead, some newcomer asshole from the “Potatoflopper” tribe claimed masses of the good stuff. Trevor got everything he could, but most of the desirable dinosaurs had been taken. I managed to get back onto the server about 15 minutes after Trevor, and sadly scraped the bottom of the barrel with every storage unit left inside the base. Only one chest appeared untouched which contained a decent amount of supplies (NOTHING like what I had seen earlier,) and in another spot I found a GPS that nobody wanted, as well as some partial flak armor.
	In the end, we took home two stegos, three trikes, three dodos, a parasaur, a little flying carnivore, and three scorpions. After uselessly trying to reason with the Potatoflopper member, we were graciously given a low-level Rex and Eagle by one of the people with whom I’d been diplomatically dividing up the spoils. Trevor retrieved these freebies, while I sorted through what little supplies we had successfully gathered.
	All in all, we got a lot of good free dinosaurs, and I really can’t complain. The timing of the server update was nothing short of astounding, and I think that is what upsets me most about this situation. We got a lot out of the raid, but could have gotten so much more.
	Hopefully things go more smoothly next time we encounter a similar thing.

Entry 9: 	Survival of the Drama Llamas
Date: 		26 - 27 September 2015
ARK ver:	215.1
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
	Trevor got in a fight with a major player on PvE-Server 333. Big Boy of the GT tribe stole a red supply drop (not at all easy to find, and usually with great loot) from right under Trevor’s nose. Trevor enacted payback by killing a level 120 Argentavis while Big Boy was trying to tame it. Big Boy retaliated by placing pillars all around (and in some places, within) our newly-expanded Riverside Compound perimeter. Meaning we cannot utilize the land we worked so hard to section off. It’s quite annoying and claustrophobic, honestly. Not being able to build anywhere outside our relatively cramped bubble is a real pain.
	After attempting to apologize to BB on Trevor’s behalf, and after waiting a full two days for BB to cool down, he finally agreed to take down the pillars he placed. I’ve warned Trevor not to bother him any more. Trevor and I have decided to defend ourselves from any future attacks by placing our own pillars around our base, once the existing ones have been removed. A great plan, honestly.
	In light of our inability to properly expand, I decided to gather a ton of oil/craft a ton of gasoline. Trevor put together a generator room, which includes an industrial grill and a fridge. We now have significantly more food than we could possibly consume. Currently, the generator uses one gasoline per hour. In about an hour of gameplay, I managed to gather enough oil to craft 200+ gasoline. So not only are we set for a while, but I now know what it would take to replenish our stockpile of gas.
	In addition, I spent a lot of yesterday and today mining metal, and today alone have brought home more than 500 pieces, as well as a little obsidian and nearly 100 crystal. Trying to make the most of a limited situation.
	Trevor and I were considering packing up shop and basically constructing a new base up north, on better land. I didn’t initially like this plan but warmed up to it after discussing it. We do need a northern presence, true. However, I don’t want to leave the base we JUST got a generator for. On the other hand, the land we chose to settle on is sloped, and does not lend itself for easy building construction. I agreed to move if Big Boy does not remove the pillars in 5 days, under the condition that we don’t abandon the shelter we created. Trevor had no problems with this, and once he’s able to play again after this weekend, he said he would attempt to gather necessary materials for the move and/or expanding the RC.
